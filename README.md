# TSPathFix
Simple no-dependency script to update relative paths in .js and .d.ts files after being generated by TypeScript compiler.

### Installation
```bash
yarn install tspathfix -D 
```
OR
```bash
npm install tspathfix --save-dev
```

### Usage
Compile TypeScript project and then run tspathfix in the same folder 
```bash
tsc
tspathfix
```

### Rationale
- Typescript Compiler (tsc) does not perform path resolving when creating .js or .d.ts files
- There are no simple solutions out there that can perform this without involving a bundler with convoluted setup
